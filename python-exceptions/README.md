Exception Handling Basics
This section provides an introduction to the basics of exception handling in Python.

Raising Exceptions
Learn how to raise exceptions explicitly using the raise statement and understand the different types of built-in exceptions available.

Catching Exceptions
Discover how to catch exceptions using try-except blocks and handle them gracefully to avoid program crashes.

Handling Multiple Exceptions
Explore techniques to handle multiple exceptions using try-except blocks with multiple except clauses and using a single except block to catch multiple exception types.

Custom Exceptions
Learn how to create custom exceptions to represent specific error scenarios and improve code clarity.

Creating Custom Exceptions
Understand the process of defining custom exception classes and customizing them according to your project requirements.

Handling Custom Exceptions
Learn how to handle custom exceptions by catching and responding to them appropriately within your code.

Examples and Exercises
This section presents practical examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding of exception handling concepts.

Example 1: Division by Zero
Illustrates how to handle the ZeroDivisionError exception when dividing a number by zero.

Example 2: File Handling
Demonstrates exception handling while working with files, such as handling FileNotFoundError and PermissionError exceptions.

Exercise: Temperature Converter
Challenges you to build a temperature converter that handles input errors using exception handling techniques.
